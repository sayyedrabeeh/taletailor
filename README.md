    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"}
    payload = {
        "inputs": prompt,

    response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        return data[0]["generated_text"]

```python
def emotion_theme(request):
    theme_class = 'theme-neutral'

    story_id = request.resolver_match.kwargs.get('story_id')
    
    if story_id:
        from Mystory.models import Story
        try:
            story = Story.objects.get(id=story_id)
            emotions = story.emotions.lower() if story and story.emotions else ''
            
            theme_map = {
                'happy': {'class': 'theme-happy', 'emoji': 'üòÑ'},

                # Additional emotions...
            }
            
            if ',' in emotions:
                primary_emotion = emotions.split(',')[0].strip()
                theme_data = theme_map.get(primary_emotion, {'class': 'theme-neutral', 'emoji': 'üòä'})
            else:
                theme_data = theme_map.get(emotions, {'class': 'theme-neutral', 'emoji': 'üòä'})
                
            theme_class = theme_data['class']
            theme_emoji = theme_data['emoji']
        except Story.DoesNotExist:
            pass
